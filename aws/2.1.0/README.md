# Deployment of a FortiAIOps-VM (BYOL) on the AWS
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiAIOps-VM on AWS

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider AWS >= 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - AWS VPC with 1 subnets
   - One FortiAIOps-VM instance with 1 NICs
   - One Network Security Group rules.
   - One Route tables

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiAIOps-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiAIOps-VM instances:
```sh
FortiAIOpsPublicIP = <FortiAIOps Public IP>
Password = <FortiAIOps Password>
Username = <FortiAIOps Username>
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
