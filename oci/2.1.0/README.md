# Deployment of a single FortiAIOps-VM on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a single FortiAIOps-VM on OCI

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.0
* Terraform Provider OCI >= 3.86.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.1.2
* A [OCI API key](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following :
   - A Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) with one public subnet
   - A FortiAIOps-VM instance with one NICs
   - One firewall rule: for the internal subnet

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiAIOps-VM to OCI:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Move the OCI API key and FortiAIOps-VM license file to the same folder
3. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
5. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiAIOps-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

Default_Username = admin
PublicIP = [
  "<FortiAIOps Public IP>",
]

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
